# Architecture Decision Records

ADR documents capture the rationale behind significant technical decisions.

## Suggested Workflow
1. Create a new ADR using the template in `docs/adr/template.md`.
2. Give it a sequential identifier (e.g., `001`, `002`) and a concise title.
3. Capture context, decision, consequences, and follow-up actions.
4. Reference ADRs from code comments or docs where the decision applies.
