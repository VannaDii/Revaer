# 075: Coverage gate tests for config loader and data toggles

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-01-03
- Context:
  - Motivation: `just cov` failed at 76.46% line coverage, blocking `just ci`.
  - Constraints: no coverage suppression, no new dependencies, and AGENT compliance.
- Decision:
  - Add focused unit tests for config loader mapping/secret helpers and data config toggle sets.
  - Alternatives considered: ignore the gate or suppress coverage reporting (rejected).
- Consequences:
  - Positive outcomes: `just cov` clears the 80% line gate; configuration mappings gain direct test coverage.
  - Risks or trade-offs: slightly longer test runtime.
- Follow-up:
  - Implementation tasks: add loader/data tests, update checklist status, run `just ci`.
  - Review checkpoints: validate coverage stays >=80% during follow-up changes.
- Test coverage summary:
  - `just cov` reports 80.45% total line coverage (gate passes).
- Observability updates:
  - None (tests only).
- Risk & rollback plan:
  - If tests become flaky, revert the test additions and re-run `just ci`.
- Dependency rationale:
  - No new dependencies; reused existing dev crates.
