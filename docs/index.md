# Revaer

> Centralized torrent orchestration with hot-reloadable configuration, consistent CLI/API surfaces, and observability-first defaults.

Revaer is a Rust workspace that coordinates torrent ingestion, filesystem operations, and operational guardrails from a PostgreSQL-backed control plane. The `revaer-app` binary composes focused crates covering the API, CLI, filesystem pipeline, telemetry, and libtorrent adapter.

## What You’ll Find Here
- **Roadmap & Specs** – Track the current Phase One scope and remaining delivery deltas.
- **Platform Interfaces** – Configuration schema, HTTP API endpoints, and CLI command reference that match the current codebase.
- **Operational Guides** – Runbook, release checklist, and setup flows for operators.
- **Architecture Decisions** – ADRs documenting trade-offs across configuration, security, and engine integration.
- **API Reference** – Generated OpenAPI description and usage guidance for the control plane surface.

Use the sidebar navigation (or `[` and `]` shortcuts) to explore individual topics. Most pages include headings that double as tags for machine-readable manifests generated by the docs indexer.

## Contributing Updates
Documentation lives next to the code. Add or edit Markdown files under `docs/`, then run:

```bash
just docs
```

This builds the mdBook site and refreshes the LLM manifests that power the documentation search experience.
